Every command on the command line has more or less the same
structure. It goes like this: 

COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

The COMMAND is the name of the program.

OPTIONS are used to change or expand the command functionality.  
They typically start with a dash - (flags) or double dashes --. 

ARGUMENTS are typically filenames or other data that are feeded to the 
command (or to one of its options). 

On this machine, there is a command called 'runme'. 
Run the command and find out how it works.
