The 'cat' command can receive a lot of arguments to concatenate files.
Likewise, many other commands on the CLI can take in more than one file. 

But writing down long lists of arguments can sometimes be tedious.

That's why Linux has powerfull wildcards that saves you time typing.     
They are called 'globs'. 

Let's start with the most powerfull of them.

The * wildcard is a placeholder for: "any character any number of times". 
That's basically saying "match me everything". 

Let's try it! Cat out "all the files" from dir-2.  

Use the * to accomplish this fast. Good luck!
