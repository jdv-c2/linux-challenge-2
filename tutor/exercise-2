As you know, the 'cat' command lets you display the contents of a file.
But it can also output the contents of multiple files at once.
That's why the name of the command is taken from the word 'concatenate'.

The cat command can take in multiple arguments. Let's see how it works.

Cat out the following files from dir-1: 
   - file-2.txt
   - file-7.txt
   - file-22.txt
   - file-35.txt
   - file-41.txt

But do it in one command, with multiple arguments.
