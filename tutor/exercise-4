.--'--'-.    

There are also one-character wildcards to match filenames:
   - The ? (question mark) matches any character but only one time.
   - The [ ] (square brackets) matches a range of characters one time.
     For example: m[a,o,u]m matches mam, mom, mum 
     or a range:  car-[1-4] matches car-1, car-2, car-3 and car-4.   

Go ahead! Cat out each tenth file from dir-1. 
  - file-10.txt
  - file-20.txt
  - file-30.txt
  - file-40.txt
  - file-50.txt

Use one-character wildcards to accomplish this fast. Good luck!
